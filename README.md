# Shopping-Cart-Mini-Project-

🛒 Shopping Cart Application (Python)

📌 Project Overview This is a simple Shopping Cart application in Python built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The application allows users to: -View available products -Add products to a cart (with quantity limit) -Update product quantities -Remove items from the cart -Checkout and generate a bill -It demonstrates the use of lists, dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and functions in Python.

🚀 Features -View Products – Display all available products with ID, name, and price. -Add to Cart – Add products with quantity (max 8 items allowed in cart). -View Cart – Show all cart items with name, price, quantity, and subtotal. -Update Cart – Change the quantity of existing items. -Remove from Cart – Delete a product from the cart. -Checkout – Display final bill and empty the cart. -Exit – Close the program

🛠️ Tech Stack Language: Python 3.8+ -Concepts Used: -Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Methods) -Lists & Dictionaries -Loops and Conditionals -User Input & Menu-driven Program

🧑‍💻 Learning Outcomes -Understand how to work with lists inside dictionaries. -Learn CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Python. -Implement Object-Oriented Programming (classes & methods). -Write a menu-driven console application.

📌 Future Enhancements -Add file/database storage for saving cart between sessions. -Apply discounts or coupons. -Build a GUI (Tkinter/PyQt) or Web version (Flask/Django).
